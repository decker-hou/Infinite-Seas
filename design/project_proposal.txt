Project Proposal:

This is a 2D game where you are a marine biologist, and you swim around in a stage full of fish,
feed them and study them.

I will be using pygame, and a bit of numpy.

Most of the visuals will be drawn with sprites.
The stage will be procedurally generated, with geographical features like islands and tunnels. Player collision 
with the stage will be precise using pygame's
mask functionality.

The fish in the stage will have sophisticated behaviour like swimming in schools, scattering in response to the player,
finding food, and navigating around stage obstacles. Their locations are randomly selected.

Physics like water resistance and waves will be simulated. You'll see seaweed that waves around in the water according
to water currents.

I will use particle physics for some visual elements such as bubbles. At this point I don't know if I will use an
existing library or write my own particle class

After all this is done I want to do some manipulation of the sprites, so they turn in 3D space, or wiggle. I think
this will require matrix math using numpy.
