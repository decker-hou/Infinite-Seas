TP peer review notes:

Suggestions:
- top of the water has waves
- currents and physics in the water push things around
- make the stage not solid black and look more natural.
- more variety in the terrain generation
- actual infinite procedural terrain generation
- different fish have different speeds and different behaviour,
just so they are differentiated more.
